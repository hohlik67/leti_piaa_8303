Input

a e
a b 3.0
b c 1.0
c d 1.0
a d 5.0
d e 1.0

Output

Current vertex: a
Next neighbors of vertex a and path to their:
b --> 3
d --> 5
Go to the b
-----------------------------------
Current vertex: b
Next neighbors of vertex b and path to their:
c --> 1
Go to the c
-----------------------------------
Current vertex: c
Next neighbors of vertex c and path to their:
d --> 1
Go to the d
-----------------------------------
Current vertex: d
Next neighbors of vertex d and path to their:
e --> 1
Go to the e
--------------------------------
The algorithm has finished work
Result of algorithm: a b c d e
